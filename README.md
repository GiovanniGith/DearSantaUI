****** Dear Santa by Giovanni Barajas ******


 This is my full-stack capstone project while attending Nashville Software School. I have built an interface for a streamlined business directory for products and services that are available 24 hours a day. The application uses React.JS , JSX, CSS and Firebase Authentication for the back-end.

Key Goals:
Give the user the ability to create Families, Family Members and a corresponding Christmas WishList.
Allow for users to be able to modify, update and delete their Families, Family Members and Wishlists. 

From your command line, be in the root directory and run npm install OR npm i for short
From your command line, be in the root directory and run npx husky install
To start your application, run npm start


The application is still in beta testing and expected to be rolled out by 3/1/2023.
